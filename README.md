Project Name: CancerCare Connect

Tagline: Bridging the Gap for Cancer Patients

1. Team Members:

Project Manager: Responsible for overall coordination and project management.
Front-End: React.js for dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
Back-End: python for server-side development.
Database: mysql for efficient and scalable data storage.
Authentication: Implement secure user authentication using JWT.
Communication: WebSocket for real-time communication.
External APIs: Integrate with healthcare APIs for relevant information.
2. Technologies:

Front-End: React.js for dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
Back-End: Node.js with Express for server-side development.
Database: MongoDB for efficient and scalable data storage.
Authentication: Implement secure user authentication using JWT.
Communication: WebSocket for real-time communication.
External APIs: Integrate with healthcare APIs for relevant information.
Alternative: Considered Django for Back-End, but opted for Node.js due to its asynchronous nature, which can be advantageous for real-time features.

3. Challenge Statement:

Problem: Cancer patients often face challenges in accessing relevant information, connecting with support groups, and managing their treatment journey.
Solution: CancerCare Connect aims to provide a centralized platform for cancer patients to access information, connect with support communities, and manage their treatment plans.
4. Risks:

Technical Risks: Potential issues with data security and privacy. Safeguard: Implement robust encryption and adhere to healthcare data protection standards.
Non-Technical Risks: Low user adoption. Strategy: Collaborate with healthcare professionals, patient advocacy groups, and hospitals to promote the platform.
5. Infrastructure:

Branching and Merging: Utilize Git with Gitflow for branching and merging.
Deployment: Deploy using a cloud platform like AWS or Heroku for scalability.
Data Population: Populate the app with curated and verified information from reputable healthcare sources.
Testing: Implement automated testing using tools like Jest and Cypress.
6. Existing Solutions:

American Cancer Society Website: Provides information but lacks personalized features.
Cancer Support Communities: Offers support groups but lacks centralized information.
Why Reimplement: CancerCare Connect aims to provide a comprehensive solution, combining information, support, and personalized treatment management.
This project envisions a platform where cancer patients can find reliable information, connect with others facing similar challenges, and manage their treatment plans effectively. Remember to consult with healthcare professionals and adhere to ethical and legal standards when dealing with sensitive health data.
